##Chapter 1

I woke up from a long dream. When I opened my eyes, I found myself sitting at a round table, surrounded by a crowd of people who were staring at me with curiosity. 

Everything looks so unfamiliar, these people and this strange surrounding. “Hey…do you guys know where I am right now? I think I had a memory loss…don’t know what exactly happened.” 

“Hey buddy, don't be afraid.” One oddly-looking dude with a rusty robotic arm moved closer to me and said, “the simple explanation is that we are in a new era, created after the collapse of what we now call the “centralized world”. 

Changes happened overnight. Nobody knows what exactly happened to the world that we used to call home. All we know now is that there was a revolution and after that the centralized system was replaced by a new decentralized social structure.


The robotic dude paused and said confidently: “The reason we are here today is to build a network state together where instead of having centralized entities make all decisions, we will ensure that equality is preserved in our communities through collective action.”

“We see an urgency to invite more people to join us as we are too few in number and time is running out. You, my friend, have the power to make a difference. Will you join us and help to build the Network State together?”

(Protagonist accepted the invitation) 













##Chap 2


After a week of learning with the mentor, the protagonist has finally arrived at an understanding of the foundational syntax that he needs to rebuild the world.

“Young man. You’ve done a great job. This new system that we are working on is very important to sustaining a decentralized society. I wish I had only known this back then before everything went out of control. Now looking back to the old days, I never felt like being myself." The mentor stared into the distance. 

"I was just trying to be like everyone else, going along with the latest internet trends, and being glued to my electronic device. It was fine until I became impulsive and lazy. I stopped making my own decisions because my phone would do it for me and I started spending money impulsively…the list goes on. I just felt like I was sick, and the cause was my excessive consumption of internet content. I wish I could destroy all electronics to stop them from further toxicating me but I just couldn't." The mentor's voice trembled and he clenched his fist tightly. 

The Big Nine and the tycoons behind them are egocentric hypocrites and liars who cared nothing for the greater good of our world but their personal interests. Their greed for money and power devoured billions of innocents, who had no idea about their fate being grasped within the hands of these puppet masters.” The mentor exclaimed furiously, his eyes glinting with dread.

##Chap3



Mentor: “Now you are about to go on your first quest. This challenge to reconstruct the monetary system is difficult and risky since the Big Nine is aware of this impending revolution. You will have 120 seconds to complete each quest. If you fail to do so, they could track you down and our base may also be exposed. However, I believe you have mastered the syntax of this world. We await your good news.” The mentor padded on the protagonist’s shoulder with encouragement. 





A strange shadow suddenly appeared in the air amongst a 
“Congratulations on succeeding the challenge! This is a great leap toward achieving decentralization." The mysterious figure clapped. 

"Those damn evil capitalists in the centralized world cared nothing about our life and death! They were insidious manipulators who controlled how and what we think. Oh how innocent were we to even understand their tricks." The shadow exclaimed with an unsettling laughter. 

"They invented digital devices and algorithms to make us hooked. Everyone was on their phone 24/7. My phone screen was the first thing I see in the morning, and the last thing I see when I go to sleep at night. My phone was my best friend whenever I felt awkward or bored because I could just whip it out and roam the virtual reality as an escape. Because all of my friends are on social media, I also keep up with the posting and sharing everyday. Besides, I always allow the app to use my physical address for tracking so I can get ads from new restaurants and stores near me. When I go on pirated websites for movies I always accept “cookies”, not knowing it was not an actual cookie ads but asking for data collection. I was just a consumer, I was tired of thinking, and I was addicted to passive consumption of what’s on my “for you page”".  The shadow recounted his experience remorsefully. 

"But I didn’t know what the consequences were. I was fooled. We were all fooled! Too many people think that a good person has nothing to hide, but in this day and age we are falling into traps by trading our valuable privacy for some temporary convenience. Think about it, we are no longer human but made into products!” The shadow vanished soon after he finished the speech, and his infuriated warning was echoing in the studio. 

##Chap 4

Although the economic system was gradually constructed in the decentralized world, It still lacks a working governance structure to enforce the social contract. The protagonist's next Quest is to build a voting mechanism to maintain social operations.

After the protagonist has successfully completed the quest, the strange shadow once again appears. 


“So do you want to know what happened after the Big Nine seized control of our minds? They went on to do things that were even more horrendous by luring the entire middle and lower class into the “consumer trap”, where they are so deep in debt that they could no longer pay back what they owed. I remember that I was barely able to pay my rent that winter, my wife lost her job, and our new born child was crying for food. Too many people went bankrupt and got evicted from their homes so you can hear all kinds of noises on the street at night. Noises from a couple who were trying to set up a tent in front of our house, people breaking up metal from their bikes to sell, and old people coughing loudly in the wind. Everyone who still lives inside a house shut their doors and curtains all day because everyone is poor, you wouldn’t want to give your last can of tomato soup to someone begging at your door." The shadow's voice reflects a mix of emotions. 


"But even so, every now and then you can hear the loud rumbling sound of cars breaking the dead silence. Who still owns a car? Of course it was the rich people, the one out of ten thousand people, who still owned luxury cars, mansions and spent lavishly. Everyone in my neighborhood hated the cars and those who drove them. How can those wicked humans be in heaven when all other people are in hell? The future seemed darker than anyone could imagine. Do you hear the people singing the songs of angry men? Civilians' hostility will soon become the seed of revolution!" The shadow declared assertively and disappeared into the mist. 













##Chap 5 

As the protagonist finished the very last quest, the strange-looking shadow appeared in the air again, but this time the shadow was no longer surrounded by a cloud of fog, it took on a human form. The shadow suddenly took off its black mask, and to everyone’s surprise, it had the face of the protagonist. 



In this last moment of revelation, the protagonist had come to the final understanding of this world and himself. 

In fact, the protagonist had been a heavy consumer of all things Web2 and was almost completely ignorant about privacy and data ownership. He frequently accepted cookies and gave his personal information for a more engaging experience online. He was always blindly scrolling through tiktok in his free time, taking recommendations from his “for you page” and following up with the latest trends. Moreover, he himself was a star employee at Techmatter, one of the Big Nine centralized companies, and contributed substantially to the demise of the centralized world. He had worked on consumer behavior prediction by tracking private data and user biometrics with no second thought. Working hours and hours, he firmly believed that it was mutually beneficial to his company and the consumers. When he attended meetings where they discussed trading user data with advertising companies, he voted for agreement. 

##Chap 6



Once again I woke up, my heart was pounding heavily, my throat was dry from gulping air, and my shirt was drenched in sweat. It was a dream. A long dream, but probably the most realistic dream I have ever had in my life. I never felt so exhausted but so hyper-emotional at the same time. For a second, I was laying on my bed and wondering if what happened in my dream last night could be the reality. I was blown away by my thoughts. 

I work at Techtop, one of the Big Nine centralized companies, as their top AI researcher. Lately, I’m working on training a model using our collected customer data. Last night, before falling asleep, I completed the task and ran a test on the model. The result is a 99.7% prediction accuracy rate of user behavior. I was not even surprised. 



It’s time for me to get going with my day. I quickly got dressed, hopped on the subway, walked through the front gate of our office building, traveled across countless cubicles, and stood tall as I went inside the glass door of the executive office. The door slammed shut, and I said “we failed.”


















##Chap 7


I know that this is not just a simple dream. It could perhaps be a prophecy, a warning from creatures in multi-dimensional space, or even the "reality" of a parallel universe. 

Whatever it might be, I’m alarmed to see the further development of the centralized world I live in. However, this time, I’m not completely hopeless because I have acquired the knowledge and skills to make changes. Our world could be better and we could avoid the unfortunate end of humanity. 

A distant voice sounded in my head:” Now, for your final quest, go ahead and actually change the world. A brighter future awaits!”
